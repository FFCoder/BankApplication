# Bank Application

## What this application is:
In an effort to increase my broad understanding of programming, I have created a bank application to practice some programming skills. I hope to include different facets of programmings such as a web portal for this imaginary bank, back-end services, and anything else I read about that I am willing to try. 

## What to expect
While I've been playing with programming for well over two years, my studying has not been extremely effecient or consistent so I have a lot to learn and some bad habits to fix. This code will not be a work of art and I will use it to recieve criticism from others on what I can fix. Please don't treat it too harshly.
